- 10 different drugs were tested;
- 4 were deemed as promising (no reasons stated);
  but based on distribution statistics Capomulin and Ramicane are good, Ceftamin and Infubinol have low variance and SEM compared to other drugs.
- There is a balanced number of mice across all drugs tested.
- Capomulin and Ramicane have the most number of mice at the end of the study.
- Apart from Capomulin (21) and Ramicane (20), all other drugs have less than 15 mice at the end of the study.
- Infubinol has an outlier as seen in the boxplot.
- There is a high correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, of 0.84.
- Interestingly, tumor volume increases after about timepoint 33, after a sharp reduction from around timepoint 24, at least for the selected mouse 'b128'.
