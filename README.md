In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
Study summary:
- 10 drugs were tested, each drug had the same number or mice at the beginning.
- Balanced gender population of mice used
- Ramicane and Capomulane are more effective to treat tumor.
- There is a high correlation between weight and average tumor volume (0.84).
- Interestingly, tumor volume increases after about timepoint 33, after a sharp reduction from around timepoint 24 for mouse s128.
